# Visual 555 Timer Calculator

Yet another 555 timer calculator. See this running live at [visual555.tardate.com](http://visual555.tardate.com)

Why? To play around with HTML5 simulation of the 555 timer circuit, and also demonstrate a grunt + coffeescript toolchain.

## Installation for Development

To hack on this, you need a recent `npm` installed, then run:

    $ npm install

Use grunt to just-in-time compile coffeescript sources as you work:

    $ grunt watch
